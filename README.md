Welcome to the EMIT Science Data System Level 4 repository.  This page holds reference material and conversions scripts in support of the Earth System Model runs made in support of EMIT. 


Each delivered granule consists of a series of output variables that are the product of a single model run.  The table below provides links to each granule, along with the parameters used to define that model run, including which model was run, what resolution the model was run at, the source input minerology, the external meteorology used (if used), the time period the run was for, and what emissions / concentration scenario was used.  Additional information about each of these can be found the the EMIT L4 ATBD.
